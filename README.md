# Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

Get it now if it's not already installed on your machine.

Verify that you are running at least node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors.

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., new-proj).

git clone https://github.com/SriVaishnaviAkula/Angular2-FormsDemo.git new-proj cd new-proj

You could start writing code now and throw it all away when you're done. If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Steps To Run angular Application

npm install 
npm start

Steps to Build the application

# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.
